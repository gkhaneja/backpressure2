\section*{Approach and expected milestones}
\begin{tabular}{L{13.5cm} r}
Brainstorm and identify suitable optimizations to reduce communication overhead and convergence time. Build a custom simulator for testing various optimizations of the back-pressure protocol and identify desirable features for the distributed protocol. & \textit{Mar 31} \\\\
Optimizations adopted for the protocol and performance evaluation on the simulator for midterm report & \textit{Apr 6} \\\\
Run the protocol as an overlay between 2-3 machines and verify the protocol details & \textit{Apr 10}\\\\
Implement and deploy optimized version as an overlay network on a testbed (OCEAN or Emulab)  & \textit{Apr 20} \\\\
Collect realistic network traffic data for experiments and test the new protocol & \textit{Apr 25} \\\\
Analyze performance in terms of following metrics: Convergence time of the protocol, routing delay and communication overhead & \textit{Apr 30} \\\\
Final report & \textit{May 11} \\\\
